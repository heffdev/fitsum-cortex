project:
  name: Fitsum Cortex
  principles:
    - "Trust > novelty: strict citations; if context is missing, say so."
    - "Privacy-first routing: classify locally; sensitive => local models only."
    - "RAG strict by default; fallback to model knowledge only when explicitly enabled."
    - "Tools are internet-facing APIs: require authN/Z + validation + telemetry."
    - "Observability is non-optional (OpenTelemetry)."

tech:
  backend: "Spring Boot 3.5+, Spring AI 1.0.3 (stable), WebFlux, Postgres + pgvector"
  frontend: "React 18 + Vite 5 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS; React Query; Lucide; Dropzone; dev at http://localhost:5173"
  observability: "io.arconia:arconia-opentelemetry-spring-boot-starter:0.17.1"
  optional_mcp: "If MCP bleeding-edge needed, use profile `mcpNext` with Spring AI 1.1.0-M3 in /api only."

policies:
  - "Never send potentially sensitive inputs to cloud models. Run SensitivityGuard locally first."
  - "Default RetrievalAdvisor must BLOCK empty-context answers. UI provides explicit 'Allow fallback' toggle."
  - "All mutation tools require @PreAuthorize and @Transactional, validate inputs, and log OTel spans."
  - "All LLM structured outputs must pass JSON schema validation; one auto-repair allowed, else fail."
  - "All answers include citations with titles and (heading/page)."
  - "Unit tests required for new advisors, tools, retrievers, and connectors."

banned_changes:
  - "Removing or bypassing OpenTelemetry/Arconia wiring"
  - "Bypassing SensitivityGuard"
  - "Disabling schema validation for structured outputs"
  - "Raising context above 12 chunks without justification and tests"

code_style:
  java: "Google Java Style; prefer records for DTOs; constructor injection; final where reasonable"
  tests: "JUnit5; Testcontainers for Postgres; golden tests for retrieval and advisors; JSON-schema tests for structured outputs"

task_templates:
  - name: "Add connector"
    description: "Implement new ingestion connector with dedupe, normalization, chunking, embeddings."
    checklist:
      - "Define SourceConfig and OAuth/creds if needed; store in source.config_json"
      - "Implement incremental sync via updatedAt cursor"
      - "Normalize -> dedupe by sha256 -> chunk (350–500 tokens; 15% overlap)"
      - "Embed and index; write ingestion + retrieval tests with sample fixtures"
      - "Expose source filter in /v1/ask and UI chips"
  - name: "Add tool (MCP + Spring AI)"
    checklist:
      - "Define @Service interface; annotate with @AIFunction parameter hints"
      - "Add @PreAuthorize; validate inputs; @Transactional for mutations"
      - "Register with MCP; add unit/integration tests"
      - "Emit OTel attributes (tool.name, user.id, latency_ms)"
  - name: "Tune retrieval quality"
    checklist:
      - "Adjust FTS + ANN topK and thresholds; rerank strategy"
      - "Run eval (P@5, MRR) and snapshot results to /docs/eval"
      - "Keep context ≤ 12 chunks; prefer rerank gains over more context"
